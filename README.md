**Text Classification NLP Project**
Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end NLP pipeline for text classification. It takes raw text data, preprocesses it, trains a machine learning/deep learning model, and predicts the category of new text inputs.

Features

Data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)

Text vectorization using TF-IDF / Word Embeddings

Model training using ML/DL algorithms (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, LSTM, BERT)

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

Prediction on new text data
